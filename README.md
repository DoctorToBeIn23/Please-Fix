# Please-Fix
Special Fields Bug: 
I will venmo you $20 if you fix the special fields issue. I need it to work together as I share tags with others from my class on a daily basis to know what cards we should be doing. This is becoming a common way people are studying in medical since the Special Fields add on has been made. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!
If $20 is not enough I will see if I can get more people at school and Reddit to pitch in... Email Mr.jacob.d.king@gmail.com
